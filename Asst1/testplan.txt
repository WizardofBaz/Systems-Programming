workload testE():

we wanted to include this test load because the other test focus only on the errors that may arrise with a normal malloc call.
however because we wrote this we wanted to make sure our code didn't inadvertently change data or as c so wonderfully puts it segmentation fault.


workload testF():

testF trys to test one error not really focused in the other test casese which is memory overflow.
